Reflection: This assignment was actually more challenging than I thought and thoroughly tested my
            research skills. It was not hard to program the calculator itself, but I had to do a lot
            of research to figure out how to make the GUI look the way I wanted it to. I was already
            familiar with grid, but by default there is no padding and everything is centered, which
            I wanted to change. I tried using pack, but that just complicated things even more and
            made it worse. I went back to grid and eventually discovered padx, pady, ipadx, ipady,
            and sticky. From there, it was smooth sailing and I was able to tinker with the values
            to get the GUI to look how I wanted it to. In addition, to address Leon's comment about
            the GUI not updating when the window is resized, I did some research and found that I
            needed to use grid_columnconfigure and grid_rowconfigure. I'm starting to warm up to
            tkinter but still a bit apprehensive about it. ðŸ˜”
Peer Reviews:
    1. Leon Gopaul: I liked your comments. They helped me understand your code a lot better,
                    especially the dictionary of operations. I also liked how you used the
                    dictionary to create the radio buttons. However, you may want to look into
                    having your widgets update automatically when you change the window size.
    2. Sebastian Plunkett: I liked how you used grid. Your GUI is well organized. However, you
                           may want to add a clear button just for user convenience.
On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid: Ryan Cheng
